## Notes

- Used nodemon so no need to restart the server for every changes
- Used React Router and Servr Side Rendering 
- used customized webpack config no other libraris like CRA
- Serverside API call
- Search the the books by title. (Please submit the form for backend API call)

## Constraints in GOODREADS API
- Not able to macker API calls form frontend. 
- No CORS header 
- No JSON endpoint

## Bugs and Pending Items.

- Not able to acces the goodreads API from frontend, so made only backend call by sumbmitting the form but the frontend code has been done just replace with working endpoint to test the react router.

- CSS not included due to adding css-loader issue in webpack config

- I am completly occupied with some tight project deleverables else could have fixed the ablove issues and also be use Redux for state management, lazy loading, pagination bootstrap foundation, less , component testing using jest and enzyme.
